Components of time series:
------------------------------
1. Trend: Long term pattern of a data distribution is known as trend
2. Seasonal: seasonal component of time series is systematic fluctuations which repeat over a time.
3. Random fluctuations: fluctuations that cannot be attributed to either seasonality or trend.
4. Cyclic: occurs when data exhibits fluctuations that are tend to be longer than seasonal patterns usally at least 1-2 years.

kinds of time series:
--------------------------
1. Additive time series: 
	fluctuations are roughly constant.
	fluctuations do not vary, 
	fluctuations are roughly constant.
	mean does not change.
	Trend+seasonality+random fluctuations= observed time series
2. Multiplicative time series:
	fluctuations are not constant.

plotting a time series analysis in R:
-------------------------
Read data in R
Save data into object
pass the object into a TS function
pass the frequency of time series
specify start of time period along with sub period.
use plot function to plot the time series.
Decompose function to decompose various components of a time series.
select the modeling techniquw to use
Build a model
Forecast
Validate 


Various forcasting techniques for Time series:
------------------------------------------
1. Exponential smoothing.
	More weightage to most recent observation
2. ARIMA - 
3. X-12 ARIMA
4. STL


Autocorelation: data at each time point might be influencing the data at the next time point.
Smoothening the time series to get rid of auto correlation

Validating a model:
------------------------
check points for validating the model.
1. forecast values are in bell park of 95% confidence interval.
2. MAPE is less than 7 or 7.3
3. whether P value of Ljung-box test indicates a serial auto-correlation.
4. if P value indicates a serial autocorrelation, check the ACF plot.
5. check for most significant spikes in the ACF plot
6. Whether the residuals are normally distributed, using a bell-shaped histogram(errors are equally distributed)


holt's model will not be able to capture the seasonality
- it can only capture the trend.

holt winter's model:
---------------------
1. single exponential smoothening - smoothing the only random fluctuations.(alpha=T)
2. double exponential smoothening - smoothing the random and trend.(alpha=T,Beta=T)
3. triple exponential smoothening -	smoothing the random, trend and seasonality.(alpha=T,Beta=T,Gamma=T)

Note Ljung box test:
-----------
1. check for auto correlation:
	Box.test(residuals, type="Ljung-Box")
	p-value should be insignificant that is >0.05.
	if p-value is significant then there is a chance of autocorrelation between the time point/data points
		so we have to perform more smoothing.
	else the data has been smoothened and randomly distributed
