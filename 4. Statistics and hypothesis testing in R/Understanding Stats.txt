paired t-test
-----------------
dependent samples
before-sample and after sample

H0 is same Mean0==Mean1
1-tailed is Ha-->mean0>mean1 or mean0<mean1
2-tailed is Ha-->mean0!=mean1

Chi-square test
----------------
multiple proportions(region level)
1. goodness of fit test (is the probabilty is equal else the sample is following any trend)
2. Association test with contingency table

ANOVA
----------------
when we have to test equality of more than 2 means we use analysis of variance
H0--> means of the groups are same.
Variance between the groups 
Variance within the groups
if variation is between the between the groups there is probably a significant effect.
if variation is with in the groups then its probably not a significant effect.


ANOVA- one way 
-----
variation with in one factor
1. only one categorical variable or single factor is considered.
2. comparision of means of 3 or more samples. if 2 samples then t-test is used.
3. H0- is the equality in the means.
4. Ha- is difference in atleast one mean.
5. independent variables is one.
6. compares 3 or more levels of one factor

ANOVA- two way
------
variation with more than one factor
replication- same no. of samples
with out replication - different no. of samples
1. analysis about the interaction between factors
2. independent variables are two
3. compares multiple levels of 2 factors.
