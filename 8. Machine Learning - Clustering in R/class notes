Supervised and Unsupervised learning
--------------------------------------
A.	Supervised Learning Algorithms: 
	1. uses trained data set and predict on test data set
	2. classification and regression
	--------------------------------
	All classification and regression algorithms come under supervised learning.

	Logistic Regression
	Decision trees
	Support vector machine (SVM)
	k-Nearest Neighbors
	Naive Bayes
	Random forest
	Linear regression
	polynomial regression
	SVM for regression


B.	Unsupervised learning algorithms:
	1. uses input data set, used for analysis.
	2. clustering, density estimation and dimensionality reduction.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	All clustering algorithms come under unsupervised learning algorithms.

	K â€“ means clustering
		we select the no. of groups to be formed.
	Hierarchical clustering or bottom up clustering
		
	Hidden Markov models

		clustering:
		--------------------
		clustering is a unsupervised learning (unlabeled data)
		data points are grouped according to the features 
		homogenity with in the group is max
		heterogenity between the group in max



Decision trees
-----------------------------
Decision trees are supervised learning.(having a predefined target variable)

Advantages of decision trees:
1.Most useful in data exploration, i.e if data has more variables then decision tree helps to identify the most significant table.
2. it can handle both numeric and categorical variables.
3. not accurate for target continous variables

types of decision trees:
1. Regression tree - dependent variable is continous
2. Classification tree - dependent variable is categorical.
both the decision trees follow top-down approach.
